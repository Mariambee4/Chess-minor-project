            Welcome to our chess page. If you want to know what led us to create yet another chess site, then read on. We love the game. We think it is quite amazing because everyone can learn the rules quickly. Getting a good grasp of the basic principles is not that hard either. So, very soon, one can start to play against friends and later, as the chess player grows stronger, can see more and more aspects of the game and its richness. Chess is for everyone and, best of all, it has nothing to do with physical abilities (or disabilities), which is very appealing to us.

           <b>The King</b> is the most important and integral piece on the chessboard and usually, all chess strategies are based around protecting your own King and attacking the opposite King. If you trap the opposite King, it is called a checkmate, which means, you won the game.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            There can be no specific numerical value assigned to the King hence alot of masters believe that the King is infinite in value. The King is placed on the e file on the first rank, to the right side of the Queen, at the start of the game. The King can move in all directions but can only move one square at a time. If any piece attacks the King, i.e, if the King comes in the range of any of the opposite colour pieces, the King is under a “check.”
        </p>
        <p align="center"><b>The Queen</b> is considered to be the most powerful piece on the chessboard with the highest calculatable numerical value of 9 points. The Queen is a long-range piece that can move in all directions but cannot jump over any piece and can cover as many squares as it wishes to. The Queen is an exceptionally strong Queen, hence protecting and actively using your Queen is very important in a game of chess.</p>
        <p align="center"><b>The Rook</b> represents the elephant on the board and is worth 5 points. It is a long-range piece where the Rook moves in a straight direction vertically and horizontally. Both White and Black have two Rooks each placed on the edge of the board, that is the ‘a’ and ‘h’ files. The Rook can move forward, backward and sideways and students find it easiest to learn the motion of the Rook.</p>
        <p align="center"><b>The Bishop</b> is a long-range piece that moves diagonally and can cover as many squares as possible without jumping over a piece and can capture pieces along the way. Each player has two Bishops and one is placed on the ‘f’ file while the other is placed on the ‘c’ file. The Queenside Bishop is located between the Queen and the Queenside Knight while the Kingside Bishop is located between the King and Kingside Knight.</p>
        <p align="center"><b>>he Knight</b> represents the horse on the chessboard and the chess piece looks exactly like the horse. It has a special power as the horse can jump over pieces and moves two and a half squares ahead, behind and sideways. To make it simpler the Knight forms an ‘L’ shape with its movements and is an integral part of the opening and development.</p>
